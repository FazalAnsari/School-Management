# School-Management
Sure, let's break down the code into key points:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
    - The code begins by importing necessary libraries for the application, including `tkinter` for GUI, `mysql.connector` for MySQL database interaction, and some modules for specific functionalities.

2. **Database Connection:**
    - It establishes a connection to a MySQL database named "school" running on localhost with the username "root" and password "123456".

3. **GUI Setup:**
    - The main GUI window is created using `Tk()`.
    - The window title is set to "ClassRoom Data Management".
    - Labels, Entry widgets, and Buttons are added for user input and interaction.

4. **Functions for Database Operations:**
    - `Register()`: Inserts a new record into the "student" table based on user input. Checks for duplicate records before insertion.
    - `Delete()`: Deletes a record from the "student" table based on the provided RollNo.
    - `Update()`: Updates an existing record in the "student" table based on the provided RollNo and user input.
    - `Showall()`: Creates a new window displaying all records from the "student" table in a TreeView widget.
    - `Clear()`: Clears all entry fields in the main window.

5. **TreeView for Data Display:**
    - The `Showall()` function uses the `Treeview` widget to display the data in tabular form. It creates a new window ("Overview Page") to show the records.
    - The TreeView has columns for RollNo, First_Name, Last_Name, Phone_Number, City, State, and Age.

6. **Buttons for Operations:**
    - Buttons for Register, Delete, Update, Show All, and Clear are added with corresponding functions (`command` attribute).

7. **Repeat Main Loop:**
    - The `Tk()` main loop (`root.mainloop()`) is used to continuously run the GUI and handle user interactions.

8. **Widget Organization:**
    - Widgets like labels, entry fields, and buttons are organized in a grid layout for a neat appearance.

9. **Error Handling:**
    - The code includes basic error handling using `messagebox` for notifying users about various operations.

10. **Image Display:**
    - An image ('image.png') is loaded and displayed using the `PhotoImage` class.

11. **Scrollbar Usage:**
    - Although not explicitly shown in the code, the `Treeview` widget often requires a vertical scrollbar for navigation when the number of records is large. However, it's not implemented in this code.

12. **Overall Structure:**
    - The code follows a structured approach, separating GUI setup, database operations, and the main loop. Functions are defined for specific tasks, enhancing modularity and readability.
